Driver_booster_setup.exe is the setup executable for Driver Booster, a software application developed by IObit, designed to help users update and manage their device drivers on Windows systems. The current version, 7.0.2.435, aims to enhance system performance and stability by ensuring that drivers are up to date, which can potentially resolve hardware compatibility issues and improve overall functionality. While Driver Booster is generally considered safe and is widely used, users should exercise caution and download it from the official IObit website to avoid counterfeit versions that may contain malware. Some users have reported errors during installation or while attempting to update drivers, which can stem from conflicts with existing drivers or issues with the Windows operating system. As with any software, it is advisable to create a system restore point before installation to mitigate any unforeseen complications.
