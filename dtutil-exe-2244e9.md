As a legitimate Microsoft product, dtutil.exe is generally considered safe and not a virus or malware; however, like any executable file, it can potentially be misused by malicious software if located in an unauthorized directory or if it has been modified. Users may encounter errors related to dtutil.exe, such as issues with package deployment or execution, which can stem from permission problems, incorrect parameters, or environment configuration issues. Ensuring that dtutil.exe is located in its proper directory and is not tampered with can help mitigate risks and maintain operational integrity when using SQL Server tools.
